put all *.c-files in the same directory (fbl, fbl_test, dllink and a_star).
Chipmunk can easily be built as a part of your project without making a library.

gcc -std=c99 *.c -o fbl_test `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer -lchipmunk -llua5.3 -lm
(if you have chipmink 7.03 dev lib installed)

something like that... try -02 also (wihout chipmunk as lib (but as source)):

Notes:

The guide is slightly outdated (http://www.frittblas.se/misc/rpi-SDL2.html) but can still be used
if you modify it like this:

libtiff5-dev didn't work last time i tried to install is (not a problem as fbl only uses png)
New list:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libfreeimage-dev libopenal-dev libpango1.0-dev libsndfile-dev libudev-dev libasound2-dev libjpeg8-dev libwebp-dev automake

No need to configure sdl in weird ways (force opengles, force fullscreen etc.)
just do
../configure
from the build-dir

sdl_image works perfect as shown in the guide.

sdl_ttf didn't work when cloned from the latest github version. Had to use slightly older version:
https://frittblas.se/upload/uploads/SDL2-2.0.14.zip

just follow above steps and install it.

The smpeg2 is no longer used by sdl_mixer (libmpg123 instead (just sudo apt_get install the dev package))
apt-cache search libmpg and you will find it.
Then build sdl_mixer, should go fine.

liblua-dev 5.3 can easily be installed.

As for chipmunk:

Rename hastyspace.c to *.c_ (pthread error, don't need it)

temporary solution:
copy the chipmunk dir from include to the src dir
go to the new chipmunk dir in src and paste another copy of the same dir(!).
Then go into that dir and paste yet another copy :>

Just copy all the cm *.c files to fbl src dir and write:

gcc -std=c99 *.c -O2 -DNDEBUG -o fbl_test `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer -llua5.3 -lm
