Install Android Studio with Android SDK (Platform 26)
Install Gradle (will happen automatically)
Install Android Nkd. I use version r21d.
You should have Java JDK installed aswell (no later version than 15.02)

Download:
https://frittblas.se/fbl/fbl_android_studio_and_cmdline_working.rar
Unrar somewhere.

cd to fbl_android_studio\fbl_project

Edit local.properties to suit your system (paths to Sdk and Ndk).

type:

gradlew AssembleDebug

Will create .apk in:

fbl_android_studio\fbl_project\app\build\outputs\apk

gradle installdebug (on device)

or release


NOTE:

Everything is working now including Lua!
The next step will be to make everything look better (on Android that is)
and support different things like "tabbing" out of app and back etc.
