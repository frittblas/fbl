Install Android Studio with Android SDK (Platform 26)
Install Gradle (will happen automatically)
Install Android Nkd. I use version r21d.
You should have Java JDK installed aswell (no later version than 15.02)

Download:
https://frittblas.se/fbl/fbl_android_latest.rar
Unrar somewhere.

cd to fbl_android\fbl_project\

Edit local.properties to suit your system (paths to Sdk and Ndk).

To build, type:

gradlew AssembleDebug

Will create .apk in:

fbl_android\fbl_project\app\build\outputs\apk

gradle installdebug (on device)

or release

NOTE:

To change project:

cd to fbl_android\fbl_project\app\jni\src\

and paste the fbl folder there, (keeping the whole dir-structure).

Edit Android.mk in that /src/-dir to suit your needs. Default
is the lotr-project (Android_fbl.mk is fbl_test.c)
