Random ideas:

talking to npc that sells stuff:

-howdy ho buy my things.
-I don't remember you being in the book?
-Oh, there's tons of stuff that happened that aren't in the book.
-what book?

Todo:
Register components and systems in sysManager class. Done!
Set the player up in Chars class (add components). Done!
Use bitset.reset() in between. Done!

Add fbl log functions (SDL_Log) (not urgent)
Add func setNew() to path-class()? Yes but not urgent :)

Change dirs in explore mode. Done!
Add unwalkable tiles. Done!

Add camera component. Done!
Add camera system. Done!
Add camera limits, lerp and deadzone. Done!
Maybe add damping even in corners?

New file, like LuaDialogue that exposes some new functions to be called
from lua, like: StartDialogue() that sets a variable that you can pick up in Lua.
Also some cutscene stuff maybe. And give items. High level gameplay things.
Set up text and font stuff (and dialogs, ui) in C++. Then do dialogue with coroutines.

Added LuaDialogue.cpp but vc doesn't like the extern lua_State variable! Fix it!
test to put(tm): extern "C" {extern lua_State variable} in LuaDialogue.cpp.

Other stuff:
Add Cards and deck, think about a good solution.
Ecs? probably! or oop..
