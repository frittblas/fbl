Checklist for beta:
1. Add a new (important) gameplay element: Dungeons!

Dungeons can be entered on specific tiles.

Once in it's completely dark?
A maze has been generated (or create a bunch of puzzles)
You control the character using cards!!! And dice.
Dice controls mana. If you get more dice you can pick the higher value.
Play all the cards you can in order and see it play out.
Example:
Torch, Move right, move up, Fireball right, move up.
Swim, Push, Accelerate, Move right.

After your turn there is an environment turn (escalators and stuff)
Then enemy turn (they attack close or ranged, or heal etc.)

Ideas for cards:
Mana cost first.
1: Torch - makes you see immediate surroundings.
2: Mega torch - makes you see everything.
1: Move - take a step (in any direction)
1: Push - will allow character to push certain blocks
0: Accelerate - make movement double (2 steps)
1: Punch - hit adjacent enemy for 5(in any dir)
1: Block - gain 5 block this turn.


2. Tweak gameplay balance.
3. Add "simulate" button to robot races so they go super fast.
4. Update to visual studio 2022 (update folder names), latest SDL (2.30.10)
5. Fix the new emscripten build (Lua?)

Ca2 will become good!
