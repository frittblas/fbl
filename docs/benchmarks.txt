10 seconds of blasting with no frame delay or timing:

(demo 6)

vs2015 with sdl 2.0.5 (32bit)

18244 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, no update, no batch, different color and alpha, same blendmode(never called SDL_SetTextureBlendMode))
10234 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, no update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blendmode_blend, other _add (no sprite sorting))
17662 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, no update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blendmode_blend, other _add (sprite sorting by blendmode))

Sorting sprites by blendmode is really good as you can see. Switching between blendmodes before rendercopy is slow if done to often.
But maybe you'll want to sort sprites by layer too? think about this.
Maybe this won't be a big problem, just don't put a different blendmode on every other sprite?


vs2019 with sdl 2.0.12 (32bit)

17888 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, no update, no batch, different color, same blendmode (never called SDL_SetTextureBlendMode))
9085 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, no update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blenmode_blend, other _add)
16708 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, no update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blenmode_blend, other _add (sprite sorting by blendmode))

21000 frames (1000 filled rects 64x64, no update, no batch, different color, same blendmode)

--Demo 6 fbl_test.c

1702 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blenmode_blend, other _add (sprite sorting by blendmode)
		the update is moving the sprites around using fbl_set_sprite_xy and fbl_get_x and _y)

7000 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blenmode_blend, other _add (sprite sorting by blendmode)
		the update is moving the sprites around using fbl_set_sprite_xy and direct coordinate references (stored in stack array))
Same result as above with filled rects.

16800 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blenmode_blend, other _add (sprite sorting by blendmode)
		the update is moving the sprites around using fbl_set_sprite_xy and direct coordinate references (stored in stack array), and new direct ref system
		in sprite.c (it really works!))

14000 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blenmode_blend, other _add (sprite sorting by blendmode)
		the update is moving the FIRST 200 sprites around using fbl_set_sprite_xy and direct coordinate references (stored in stack array))

11800 frames (1000 sprites 64x64, update, no batch, different color, half of sprites have blenmode_blend, other _add (sprite sorting by blendmode)
		the update is moving the LAST 200 sprites around using fbl_set_sprite_xy and direct coordinate references (stored in stack array))
