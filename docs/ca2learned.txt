Very good structure, some file too big (maze, robotCollection etc.)
Better UI system (more flexible)! - Just use imGui :)

Design classes with more private members and initializer lists

const reference parameters!

learn templates completely.

Use more range based loops.

More files, folders, classes, functions. Break down problems even more.
