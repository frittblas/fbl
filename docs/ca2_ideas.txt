-howdy ho buy my things.
-I don't remember you being in the book?
-Oh, there's tons of stuff that happened that aren't in the book.
-what book?

New file, like LuaDialogue that exposes some new functions to be called
from lua, like: StartDialogue() that sets a variable that you can pick up in Lua.
Also some cutscene stuff maybe. And give items. High level gameplay things.
Set up text and font stuff (and dialogs, ui) in C++. Then do dialogue with coroutines. On the way!
Trigger system to start dialogues! 95 % Done!

Added LuaDialogue.cpp but vc doesn't like the extern lua_State variable! Fix it!
test to put(tm): extern "C" {extern lua_State variable} in LuaDialogue.cpp. Done!!

Add Tile flip in ScenEdit - Done!

--TODO NEXT--

Draw you own sprites! And own ip :)... DONE!
Add animated water-"corner" (4 of them) to make lakes. Done!
Draw characters before weather :) (now brodo is walking on the clouds). Done!
Fix green borders on mobile. - Tried black rects, did not work.. Seems to work with the new logical res trick, experiment further!
Start to add sounds and music - in progress, it's glorious.
Make a sound system for music, ambient sounds and sfx. - in progress.

Make nice transition between levels. Two filled rects that meet in the middle of the screen. Also some text describing the location.
Add ability to choose which way to go (can only choose one direction!), a pathway will open up. You should be able to backtrack.
Add some nice tiles (more grass, snow etc) - in progress.
Make a couple of nice levels that are final-ish - in progress.
Make the tile-type 0-9 be terrain. 10-19 = objects (pushable blocks, shops, secret passage etc.) 20-up NPCs

Small bug: If you click Talk, after the conversation the player will path to the Talk button coords :) FIXED!!!!!

Start planning the racing system! Make new folder makes sense. - done.
Maybe add more detailed folder structure.
Add #ifdef cplusplus in the html5 section of emscripten build to build easier.

Other stuff:
Player can find skills in chests, called programs. Passive or active skills.


robot collection menu! - almost done!
the actual game (race) - on the way :)

Team of 3 robots to compete?
Random and ready made levels?
passive and active skills.

Sprite layers are:
Ground tiles (grass and blocks): 0
Player: 1
Tunnel tiles (player goes under): 2
Clouds: 3
Gray collectionMenu BG: 4
Robots: 5

Come up with a solution for the collectionMenu being susceptible to time of day :)

MAYBE looks like a good idea to remove path component of the robots in explore mode :)
at least if you use mousectrl on one of the robots, and hop between race and explore.

Next:
Add pick start, randomize rest.
Add different kinds of laser.
Add magnetic passive ability.
Add teleport.
