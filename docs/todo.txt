Basic Sprite collission - Done
Fix Sprite/text to screen - Done
Sprite sorting/layers - Done
UI - Buttons and checkbox - Done

Primitives + vector graphics - working! In more progress..
Physics - working! in more progress..
Lua - working! In more progress (just map all functions to Lua).. DONE!!
Alpha and color blending - Done!
Particles - Working! in more progress..
Multiplayer - in progress w peerjs.. will finish for ver. 1.0. (maybe sdl_net is better or libdatachannel)
Audio - samples and music working. Can't get ogg to work in emscripten yet (try inline asm!!).
!! Found temporary solution: Rename the *.ogg music files you want to use to *.wav.
Pathfinding - Done. UPDATE: no need to rename anymore. sdl_mixer work like a charm in emscripten now.

2D lights (using blendmode, lightmaps?) - 
Scene editor - (start by making a simle tilemap editor?)

OpenGL es2 (ver 2.0)
Shaders (ver 2.0)

Fix this:

In RPI build. Don't use strcpy_s()!!! (sound.c and maybe more) fix this (Fixed!). M_PI is undefined (FIXED!).
Add a make-file for linux? (yes why not.)
Fix deactivate physics object (sprite or prim) then activate again with all params intact.
Fix click events working w touch on html5 mobile. DONE!!!
Fix polygon shape on tris - done but no physics yet.
Fix main.lua not constantly looping - (mabe no? Just don't call fbl_init lua() then)
Fix change phys hitbox when change size on prims (that means add fbl_change_prim_size())
Fix Xcode proj lua (won't compile if lua lib is included silly error should work)

Demo 1 and 2 can't cycle between each other! Why? FIXED!!! physics wasn't freed correctly!!

Add VS2019 template - Done.
Make project "compilable" with latest emscripten version (with SDL2 mixer) (instead of SDL1). - 99% done check "changes to emscr 1.3.9.txt"
in emscripten folder. DONE!! 

update to SDL2 2.0.12 - in progress.. - DONE! (will compare batch speed later)
update to latest SDL project libs (sdl_image etc) - in progress... Done!

remember in VS2015/2019 properties Linker->system->subsystem->console or not! - Done!

Vs2015 template is using sdl 2.05 (so you can compare the batch system etc (se benchmarks.txt))

fbl is now up to date with, emscripten 2.07, sdl 2.012, lua 5.4.1 chipmunk 7.0.3!!

--

For future:

Adhd JS buttons interacting With canvas
add fbl_batch_layer to combine all sprites in a layer (maybe, or wait until 2.09 is released with emscripten (looking into it))
to one texture for optimisation.

--

Also an idea for omtimisation: Add a sprite function, fbl_sprite_direct_ref(). After all the wanted sprites has been created,
allocate memory for a dynamic array that holds pointers to all entries in the linked list. So when you call get_sprite_item_at_id(int id)
in sprite.c, it returns the pointer by having a direct reference like an array instead of having too loop the linked list every time you need
a value. This should speed things up insanely when you have lots of moving sprites for example.

void *ptr;
ptr = malloc(num * sizeof(ptr));
maybe?
then ptr[id] is a direct memory location.

This could also be done for prims.

DONE!! Very big improvement, if you call the set and get functions every frame.

--

Make the demos nice (add big tilemap for example)! - in progress..

--

Make the 64bit version build. - almost done, need 64 bit version of lua. compile 64 bit version like this:

Try starting 64 bit msvc command prompt, then:

cl /MD /O2 /c /DLUA_BUILD_AS_DLL *.c
ren lua.obj lua.o
ren luac.obj luac.o
link /DLL /IMPLIB:lua5.4.1.lib /OUT:lua5.4.1.dll *.obj
link /OUT:lua.exe lua.o lua5.4.1.lib
lib /OUT:lua5.4.1-static.lib *.obj
link /OUT:luac.exe luac.o lua5.4.1-static.lib

x64 bit version DONE!! (will benchmark later, UPDATE: 64-bit version seems to be slightly faster, 5% more frames? (check benchmark.txt))

--

fbl_set_window_title() is not in lua! fix it :} -- DONE!!

--


work on primitives.c! (optimise, culling, add blendmodes, on particles also :))


Add culling system. DONE!! for sprites, it was a gr8 success went from 330fps to 2700fps (10000 on screen sprites vs off screen). Using SDL2's
built in culling, it went from 330 to 960fps, so big improvement. Also add same system to prims! DONE!!

make sure the update thread for particles is ended when switching demos!

check if you can pass true/false to fbl functions from lua. (otherwise just use 1 and 0)

benchmark rectfills vs sprites (for the particle system) Done, check benchmark.txt (similar speed)

fix: tried to number of active particles :) Done.

Maintain everything, write more todos. Add ui buttons to the demos (same function as f1-f2). Comments. Then start robotgame.

1. culling for prims (3300 fps wo cull 10000 rects. same with camera off! applying culling system.. Gr8 success! 24000 frames! off screen)
1.5: Add direct ref to prims. (1400 frames before (2000 moving rects) 12000 frames after) gr8 success.
2. Add setviewscale and viewport and set logical size. Done! 145 fbl_funcs now.
3. fbl_sort_sprites blend or layer. Done!
4. add ui buttons on demo. Done!
5. add fix to screen particles. Done! (only emitters not particles :s (maybe fix))
6. culling for particles. Done!

Gr8 job (maybe search for NOTE: in the code and fix those things :))

fix vs2019 linker incompatibility. fixed! added /d2:-AllowCompatibleILVersions to linker options.

the direct ref system messes up sprite sorting! for obvoius reasons. fix it. also fix delete sprite/prim:) DONE!!!
(was this necessary? they point at the same thing? NO! it was necessary, the ref array pointed att the containers
but the content had been switched around)
fullscreen works in escripten with F9, F10, F11.
black sprite in robot game are transparent in emscripten version. (This seems to have fixed itself in later emscripten versions :)

Threadpool is now working great!
todos:
make it work under emscripten.

fix the input key_up redundant thing.

Start OpenGL renderer! - on the way.

Add networking with SDL_net (or libdatachannel maybe)
LuaJit?

make it compile w cpp. DONE!
create file fbl.hpp that contains:
    extern "C" {
    #include "fbl.h"
    }

for 0.9.8 release {
Add Cpp-support - DONE!
Add working android port with Lua - works! Just clean up and make look good :) DONE! (will make look better)
Make more streamlined cross compilation between win, web and android. DONE!
When loading assets, fix android path. (no assets/) Use #ifdef __ANDROID__  DONE!
const char* in platform_string thing, and .h-file DONE!
fix NAME _OF asset folder thing, bug prone :} DONE!

Add raycasting - 2 days left :) DONE!
Make a somewhat playable version of the robot game (also on android). On da way!
Refactor stuff - done!

Add RELEASE.md - done!


}


for 0.9.9 release {

Make work on RPI and Ubuntu for fun. DONE!! (fbl now works perfectly on both platforms without changes to the source,
makefile? yes later)
Fix the delete last item in dll-crash already! (hmm.. no, leave it forever it's charming :), maybe print something when it happens? (done))
Unittests? no, nice try though. (the demos and games are the best tests)
Add command input system? no, better for the specific game.

Fix activate/deactivate sprite/primitive with physics. DONE!!! finally (physics get destroyed when the sprite/prim
is deactivated (have to set_sprite_phys() again))

Change TP_TASK to FBL_TP_TASK. DONE!! :)
2d lights (light map and and nice pngs with gradients, circles and stuff, give sprite new variable: is_light) DONE!! Went really well.
Remove the redundant emscripten chipmunk include dir. DONE!! nice..
Make "NAME_OF_ASSET_FOLDER" or whatever a fbl-command. So you can change it in code. So the robot game works :) DONE!!

Scale Android and fullscreen pc to fill the screen! experimenting, scale works great but mouse is off. Logical doesn't work (am I using it right?)

Fix one particle to screen. (don't worry, threads will help with performance w. alot of particles :)

Make android version concat the required .lua-files then run the lua load_string().
Raycast collission (shape gets returned (i think), but who's hape is it? :)
Delete demo 1. Make something else :) demo 1 is horrible.

Add set_sprite_image to lua

start SceneEdit
start Lotro


}


for 1.0 {

SDL_net

}


Gamepad/joysticks, polish input system. (not urgent)
Update dependencies. (not urgent)
Use SDL_Log instead of fprintf(). (not urgent)

New fbl-funcion that just prints all the versions of the
dependencies. Look below. (not urgent)

SDL_version compiled;
SDL_version linked;

SDL_VERSION(&compiled);
SDL_GetVersion(&linked);
SDL_Log("We compiled against SDL version %u.%u.%u ...\n",
       compiled.major, compiled.minor, compiled.patch);
SDL_Log("But we are linking against SDL version %u.%u.%u.\n",
       linked.major, linked.minor, linked.patch);


Keep the same naming conventions (uint_32 etc) throughout the project. (not urgent)
