This is supposed to be a super simple map editor that outputs Lua-code.

Use the fbl UI-functions and create a simple interface for drawing sprites after
loading a sprite-sheet. Allow ability to set layers, sort by layer, turn on
physics (static(not impl. yet (do it!))/kinetic).

Then just output a Lua file that creates all the sprites and sets the correct
properties, that can be loaded in a game.
